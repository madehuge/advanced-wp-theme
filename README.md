---

## 🛡️ Security Hardening

* Always validate and sanitize inputs (`sanitize_text_field`, `esc_html`, etc.)
* Use **nonces** in AJAX and forms
* Disable file editing in `wp-config.php`:

  define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );
  ```

## 🚀 Performance Tips

* Enable caching (e.g., WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache)
* Use a CDN for assets
* Optimize images (WebP recommended)
* Use `defer`/`async` for non-critical JS
